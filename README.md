# Protein_Ratio_Representation

Machine learning with ratio-based proteomic features enhances prediction of disease.



## Requirements
This project was developed and tested with the following:
- python==3.9.21
- jupyter==1.1.1  
- notebook==7.3.2  
- jupyterlab==4.3.5
- numpy==2.0.2  
- pandas==2.3.0  
- matplotlib==3.9.4  
- scikit-learn==1.6.1  
- flaml==2.3.6  
- lightgbm==4.6.0 


## Quick Start Summary:
1. Update BASE = "toy_dataset" in the notebooks
2. Run AD_Ratios_Plotting.ipynb (it includes preprocessing)
3. View the generated plots and metrics.

The pipeline is self-contained and will work with the provided toy dataset files.
